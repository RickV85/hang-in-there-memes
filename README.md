### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
We created a random poster generating application that allows a user to customize and build inspirational poster/memes.
Features added allows users to save, delete, and create inspirational posters/memes that can be saved and displayed on the UI.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
1. Fork it.
2. Clone it. Copy and paste the SSH
3. Open in text editor
4. Run open index.html in the terminal

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This project was a fun way to flex our code muscles and was a massive achievement that both of us contributed to in the allotted time given. We were given 6 days to complete this project on our 1st mod in week 2.

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Write clean, DRY JavaScript and leverage classes, functions and iterations. 
Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM

<br>

Defined collaboration skills
We used the technical language of Javascript, git, github.
Applied Git Workflow, Google, Turing, our cohort mates :)

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
Technical Wins included: setting up the functionality to manipulate the DOM and UI. Saving the saved posters and pushing it into our data model. 
Challenges included delete function and display issues with the saved poster.
As a pair, we were able to overcome this challenge through by rubber ducking off each other and talking though the issues verbally out loud.
